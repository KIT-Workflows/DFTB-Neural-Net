<p>The data distribution can be observed at Fig.1, the training data had a range from "{{ Train_Range }}" kcal/mol and the
 test data had ranged on "{{ Test_Range }}" kcal/mol.:</p>

The corelation between the ORCA generated data against the DFTB+ generated data can be seen in Fig. 2, while the delta correlation can be seen
 at Fig. 3. The energies used as reference were:
<li>"{{ DFTB_reference_energy }}" for DFTB</li>
<li>"{{ ORCA_reference_energy }}" for DFT</li>

The used neural network consisted on "{{ Neurons }}" neurons distributed in "{{ Layers }}" hidden layers for each element of the system. 
The activation function was "{{ Activation_function }}". The input layer consisted on "{{ Number_of_symmetries }}" for each one of the atoms. 
The data set was divided in Training, Validation and Test with its respective number of structures: "{{ Training_structures }}", "{{ Validation_structures }}", "{{ Testing_structures }}".


The RMSE of the training was "{{ RMSE }}" and the MAE was of "{{ MAE }}". The accuarcy plot of the test set can be seen at Fig.4.
