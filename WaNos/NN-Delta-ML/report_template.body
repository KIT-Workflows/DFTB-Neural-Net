<p>The data distribution can be observed at Fig.1, the training data had a range from <li>{{ "Train range" }}</li> kcal/mol and the test data had ranged on <li>{{ "Test range" }}</li> kcal/mol.:</p>

The corelation between the ORCA generated data against the DFTB+ generated data can be seen in Fig. 2, while the delta correlation can be seen at Fig. 3. The energies used as reference were <li>{{ "DFTB reference energy" }}</li>
for DFTB and <li>{{ "ORCA reference energy" }}</li> for DFT.

The used neural network consisted on <li>{{ "Neurons" }}</li> neurons distributed in <li>{{ "Layers" }}</li> hidden layers for each <li>{{ "Elements" }}</li> of the system. The activation function was <li>{{ "Activation function" }}</li>. The input layer consisted on <li>{{ "Number of symmetries" }}</li> for each one of the atoms. 
The data set was divided in Training, Validation and Test with its respective number of structures: <li>{{ "Training structures" }}</li>,<li>{{ "Validation structures" }}</li>, <li>{{ "Testing. structures" }}</li>.

The RMSE of the training was <li>{{ "RMSE" }}</li> and the MAE was of <li>{{ "MAE" }}</li>. The accuarcy plot of the test set can be seen at Fig.4.
